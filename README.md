Please do not fork this mod nor redistribute this mod, nor create brand new games utilizing this mod's code, gun visual designs, nor weapon mechanics in their entirety (borrowing some is permitted).

Please instead submit pull requests for any fixes or compat code you may wish to offer.

You are also permitted explicitly *to port this gun mod to other games, via any means, including any design based assets.*

For example, you may port this mod to become a Counter Strike Source mod.  But you are not permitted to make a new game in Unity engine from the ground up with all of this gun mod's weapon designs and their mechanics/behaviour.
